Developed a machine learning pipeline using Python. I began with data exploration and pre-processing to prepare the dataset for analysis. 

I then applied supervised learning models for classification to detect DDoS attacks, followed by unsupervised learning techniques for clustering to group similar attack types. 

The final step was analyzing and explaining the clusters to gain deeper insights into the attack patterns.
